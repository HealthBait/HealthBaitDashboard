# HealthBaitDashboard
- Health Bait is an app that helps users stick to their goals by allowing them to stake money on the completeness of their fitness goals backed with an advance analytics dashboard and chrome extension.
- The user stakes certain amount of money after creating a goal which is locked in the group. The money is re-claimed if the persion is able to complete his goal on time(decided by votes of friends in group) and is split among group members if he is not able to.
- A user can only vote in a goal deciding decission if he has his own goal in which the current user is a member. This ensures that the user does not give out fake votes since he would face the similar situation in his goals otherwise.
- The users unlock badges on completion of their goals which can be shared on social media channels. The users with higher badges also get more share in the splitting process.
- The 3D character visualisation allows users to create their own virtual character by choosing options like their height, wieght, waist, arm and calf length and girth etc. to help them visualize their progress better.
